      in a similar way, allowing users to list and book properties for
      short-term stays. PakBnB is specific to Pakistan and aims to provide a
      platform for local hosts to rent out their homes or rooms to travelers
      visiting the country. Like Airbnb, it offers a range of accommodation
      options, from private rooms to entire apartments and houses. The website
      and app feature detailed listings and reviews, as well as a user-friendly
